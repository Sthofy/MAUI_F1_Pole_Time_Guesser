# Maui F1 Guess Game App

I developed this app to improve my skills. So I am an F1 fan and the commentators in my country invented a game. Guess the pole position time and the winner. This app represent my solution for this problem and other features. I implement a driver standings page, schedule page, reaction time test game, quiz game from current season.

Work in progress...

 The app is using data from [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/).
